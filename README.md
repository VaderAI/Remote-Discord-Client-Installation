# Remote-Discord-Client-Installation
It is not confirmed whether this type of tech is bannable or not bannable in discord, since a bot token is used rather than a user token, so use at your own risk. 

Installation process is quite tedious, so you better read carefully. Pictures for each step will be provided

1) Set up two discord bots, and named them whatever you want. Name your first bot (Username(RDC)) and your second bot (Username(LIS))

2)Now that you set your bots up, go to the website called repl.it. Set up two new Node.js projects. Name one of them Remote Discord Listener, and the other Remote Discord Sender. 

3) Once you set up the two projects, go to the packages section of the repl.its and download the Discord.js package for both Repls. 

4) Afterwards, go to the scriptone.js of this github, and copy paste the code to the Remote Discord Listener repl.
